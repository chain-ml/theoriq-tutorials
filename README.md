## SDK

**[Theoriq SDK](https://github.com/chain-ml/theoriq-agent-sdk)** simplifies the integration of an agent into the Theoriq Protocol by abstracting the necessary security requirements, allowing agents to participate in the ecosystem with minimal setup. 

In this set of tutorials, we provide different examples to familiarize the developers with Theoriq SDK, and Theoriq Protocol's capabilities.
